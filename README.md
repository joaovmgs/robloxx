Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.5.1.

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "ro.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `ro.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```

For more help, check out [the Rojo documentation](https://rojo.space/docs).

## Project Structure (Gameplay)

- `src/shared/Config.luau`: central config for grid size, tile thickness, tool ranges.
- `src/shared/Grid.luau`: reusable grid math (world↔cell, snap, key).
- `src/shared/Remotes.luau`: helper to create/access RemoteEvents (server/client-safe).
- `src/server/SpecsPublisher.luau`: publishes grid/tile specs to `ReplicatedStorage/Specs`.
- `src/server/HoeService.luau`: authoritative tilling placement, snap to grid, no overlaps.
- `src/server/init.server.luau`: boots terrain, publishes specs, starts HoeService, handles chopping.
- `src/client/HoePreview.luau`: ghost preview snapped to grid + click-to-place.
- `src/client/init.client.luau`: UI, tool selection, progress UI, integrates HoePreview.

## How Tilling Works (Aligned Blocks)

- Server snaps placements on a fixed grid defined in `shared/Config.luau`.
- Clients show a ghost aligned to the same grid; color indicates validity.
- Server raycasts to find ground height and prevents overlaps per cell.
- Tile size is driven by `ServerStorage/Dirt` if present; otherwise Config.

### Changing Block Size

- Keep your Dirt model at any size (e.g., 10×1×10). Set `Config.CellSize` to the same X/Z so snapping aligns.
- If no Dirt model exists, the server creates a basic `Part` sized by `CellSize` and `TileThickness`.

### Reuse

- Use `Grid.worldToCell`/`cellToWorldCenter` in other systems (e.g., crop growth) to keep alignment consistent.
- Use `Remotes.get(name)` to standardize RemoteEvents.
